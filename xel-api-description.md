# The XEL API Description
-------------------
- <a href="xel-api">XEL API</a>
-------------------
# 1 Description
-------------------

The XEL API allows interaction with XEL nodes using HTTP requests to port 17876. Most HTTP requests can use either the GET or POST methods, but some API calls accept only the POST method for security reasons. Responses are returned as JSON objects.

Each API call is documented below, with definitions given for HTTP request parameters and JSON response fields, followed by an example:

* The JSON response fields are each followed by one of S for string, A for array, O for object, N for number or B for boolean.
* In the examples, the XEL node is represented as localhost and requests and responses are formatted for easy reading; line breaks and spaces are not actually used except in some parameter values. All requests are in URL format which implies the HTTP GET method. When GET is allowed, the URL can be entered into a browser URL field but proper URL encoding is usually required (e.g., spaces in a parameter value must be replaced by + or %20). Otherwise, the URL should be used as a guide to preparing an HTTP POST request using cURL, for example.

All API calls can be viewed and tested at http://localhost:17876/test while the local server node is running. For specific API calls, use http://localhost:17876/test?requestType=specificRequestType.

-------------------
# 2 General Notes
-------------------

-------------------
### 2.1 Genesis Block
-------------------

Many API requests make reference to the genesis block. FYI, the genesis block's ID is 13769421951337852026 .

-------------------
### 2.2 Quantity Units XEL, NQT and QNT
-------------------

The XEL system has a currency XEL used to quantify value in the system. Like all currencies, XEL circulates in the system, moving from one user to another by payments . Also, a small fee is required for every transaction, including those in which no XEL is transferred, such as simple messages. This fee goes to the owner of the node that forges (generates) the new block containing the transaction that is accepted onto the blockchain.

One hundred millions XEL were created in the Genesis Block, and no new XEL will ever be created. XEL is divisible to eight decimal places. Yet internally, the currency is still stored in integer form in units of NQT or NxtQuant, where 1 XEL = 108 NQT. All parameters and fields in the API involving a quantity of XEL are denominated in units of NQT, for example feeNQT. The only exception is the field effectiveBalanceNXT, used in forging calculations.

The XEL system can be thought of as an asset owned by all who posses XEL. In this sense, XEL quantifies ownership of or stake in the system. Stakeholders are entitled to forge blocks and collect transaction fees in proportion to the amount of XEL they possess.

-------------------
#### 2.3 Creating Unsigned Transactions
-------------------

All API requests that create a new transaction will accept either a secretPhrase or a publicKey parameter:

* If secretPhrase is supplied, a transaction is created, signed at the server, and broadcast by the server as usual.
* If only a publicKey parameter is supplied as a 64-digit (32-byte) hex string, the transaction will be prepared by the server and returned in the JSON response as transactionJSON without a signature. This JSON object along with secretPhrase can then be supplied to Sign Transaction as unsignedTransactionJSON and the resulting signed transactionJSON can then be supplied to Broadcast Transaction. This sequence allows for offline signing of transactions so that secretPhrase never needs to be exposed.
* unsignedTransactionBytes may be used instead of unsigned transactionJSON when there is no encrypted message. Messages to be encrypted require the secretPhrase for encryption and so cannot be included in unsignedTransactionBytes.

-------------------
#### 2.4 Prunable Data
-------------------

Prunable data can be removed from the blockchain without affecting the integrity of the blockchain. When a transaction containing prunable data is created, only the 32-byte sha256 hash of the prunable data is included in the transactionBytes, not the prunable data itself. The non-prunable signed transactionBytes are used to verify the signature and to generate the transaction's fullHash and ID; when the prunable part of the transaction is removed at a later time, none of these operations are affected.

Prunable data has a predetermined minimum lifetime of two weeks (24 hours on the Testnet) from the timestamp of the transaction. Transactions and blocks received from peer nodes are not accepted if prunable data is missing before this time has elapsed. After this time has elapsed, prunable data is no longer included with transactions and blocks transmitted to peer nodes, and is no longer included in the transaction JSON returned by general-purpose API calls such as Get Transaction; the only way to retrieve it, if still available, is through special-purpose API calls such as Get Prunable Message.

Prunable data can be preserved on a node beyond the predetermined minimum lifetime by setting the nxt.maxPrunableLifetime property to a larger value than two weeks or to -1 to preserve it indefinitely. To force the node to include such preserved prunable data when transactions and blocks are transmitted to peer nodes, set the nxt.includeExpiredPrunables property to true, thus making it an archival node.

Currently, there are two varieties of prunable data in the XEL system: prunable Arbitrary Messages and Tagged Data. Both varities have a maximum prunable data length of 42 kilobytes.

-------------------
### 2.5 Admin Password
-------------------

Some API functions take an adminPassword parameter, which must match the nxt.adminPassword property unless the nxt.disableAdminPassword property is set to true or the API server only listens on the localhost interface (when the nxt.apiServerHost property is set to 127.0.0.1).

All Debug Operations require adminPassword since they require some kind of privilege. On some functions adminPassword is used so you can override maximum allowed value for lastIndex parameter, which is set to 100 by default by the nxt.maxAPIRecords property. Giving you the option to retrieve more than objects per request.

-------------------
### 2.6 Roaming and Light Client Modes
-------------------

The remote node to use when in roaming and light client modes is selected randomly, but can be changed manually in the UI, or using the new set API Proxy Peer API, or forced to a specific peer using the nxt.forceAPIProxyServerURL property.

Remote nodes can be blacklisted from the UI, or using the Blacklist API Proxy Peer API. This blacklisting is independent from peer blacklisting. The API proxy blacklisting period can be set using the nxt.apiProxyBlacklistingPeriod property (default 1800000 milliseconds).

API requests that require sending the secret phrase, shared key, or admin password to the server, for features like forging, are disabled when in roaming or light client mode.

-------------------
# 3 Create Transaction
-------------------

-------------------
#### 3.1 Create Transaction Request
-------------------

The following HTTP POST parameters are common to all API calls that create transactions:

* secretPhrase is the secret passphrase of the account (optional, but transaction neither signed nor broadcast if omitted)
* publicKey is the public key of the account (optional if secretPhrase provided)
* feeNQT is the fee (in NQT) for the transaction:
  * 1 XEL for the first 32 bytes of a unencrypted non-prunable message, 1 XEL for each additional 32 bytes
  * 2 XEL for the first 32 bytes of an encrypted non-prunable message, 1 XEL for each additional 32 bytes. The length is measured excluding the nonce and the 16 byte AES initialization vector.
  * 1 XEL for the first 1024 bytes of a prunable message, 0.1 XEL for each additional 1024 prunable bytes
  * 1 XEL for Set Account Info, including 32 chars, with 2 XEL additional fee for each 32 chars
  * 1 XEL otherwise, where 1 XEL = 100000000 NQT
#### Note: To calculate the minimum fee automatically, set feeNQT to 0 and broadcast to false. The fee will be returned in the result JSON, under transactionJSON.feeNQT.
* deadline is the deadline (in minutes) for the transaction to be confirmed, 32767 minutes maximum
* referencedTransactionFullHash creates a chained transaction, meaning that the current transaction cannot be confirmed unless the referenced transaction is also confirmed (optional)
  broadcast is set to false to prevent broadcasting the transaction to the network (optional)
#### Note: An optional arbitrary message can be appended to any transaction by adding message-related parameters as in Send Message.

#### Note: Any phasing-safe transaction (refer to Create Transaction) can have its execution deferred either conditionally or unconditionally.

### Note: To create a new event listener, omit both add and remove. To remove an existing event listener, set remove to true and omit event; all registered events will be removed, any outstanding Event Wait will be completed and the listener will be deactivated.

### Note: An event listener is automatically deactivated whenever all registered events are removed or if Event Wait is not called frequently enough, according to the nxt.apiEventTimeout property. The timeout is not precise; the removal process runs every nxt.apiEventTimeout / 2 seconds, so that many extra seconds may elapse before removal; the first Event Wait call should be made immediately after registration to avoid deactivation.

### Note: Each API user (with a unique address) can create only one event listener. When a new one is created, it will replace an existing one. The maximum number of unique users is controlled by the nxt.maxEventUsers property.

### Response:

* registered is true if the operation completed successfully

### Notes: The call returns immediately if one or more events have occurred since the last call; multiple events are all returned together. If a new call is made before the last one returns, the timeout timer resets to the new value. Event registration expires if wait calls are not made frequently enough, according to the nxt.apiEventTimeout property.

* events (A) is an array of event objects each of which has the following fields:
 * name (S) is the name of the event (refer to Event Register for the list of event names)
