# About Xel Miner
-----

This tool is the core of the entire XEL network. Opposed to what the name suggests, it is way more than just a miner. It is a fully fledged ePL to C conversion and compilation tool, that helps you to convert your ePL program to C, compile it into executable machine code, and natively execute your ePL programs on your local machine. On top of that, it allows you to pull work from other scientists on the XEL network and search for solutions to their algorithms. Once a solution is found, xel_miner is capable of submitting it to the network in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards.
