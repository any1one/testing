Hi everyone !
Last month has been a bit slower than before, but here is some news for you :

---
## Technical 

### testnet
We've successfuly restarted the testnet that was abandonned since last summer. Everyone can connect a xeline client to it, if you need any help come reach us in discord !

### developer tools 
We reorganized the developer tools repo on github : https://github.com/xel-community/xel-developers-tools
You can find the api documentation with examples, proof-of-concepts and tools to develop in ePL.

### in progress
- The new website is still on progress.
- We had a few talks with the lead dev to improve our ePL skills, the task is not easy but we are working on it to provide the best help we can !
- We are discussing a few options to make the wallet more user-friendly, and globally the whole node/miner installation. We are always curious about your feedback on that (which wallet do you use, what would you like to do with it ?)

---
## Social/Marketing
We are finally on Delta Direct and currently being onboarded for Blockfolio Signal, won't be long until we're live !
We also started testing the MintFlint app (https://www.mintflint.com/index.html), we are glad to be able to collaborate with another promising crypto project.

### in progress
- We are maintaining our efforts to finish the elastic to xel rebranding, you must have seen the changes on CoinMarketCap and Bittrex, we are still referenced as Elastic at some places, we're on it !

---
## Partnerships
We are still in touch with several researchers in universities, the goal is to keep spreading the work about the project and maybe find a way to address some issues they could have.

---
## Funding/governance
Last month we talked about the funding issues, we are still committed to find a proper way to find new funds in order to this project to keep growing, several leads so far but too soon to talk about them. If you think you can help us in any way, please reach out to us :)
We are also working on defining the path for xel in the future, regarding both the technology and the philosophy :)
