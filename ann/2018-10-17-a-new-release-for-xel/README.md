# A New Release For XEL

Alright guys. We have awesome news for you.

After weeks of work and priceless help from the community, we present to you the
3.1.3 lite wallet.

Nothing new regarding the core technology, but a massive rework of the project
to get rid of obsolete scripts and stuff like that.

The real improvement is the release of multi-platform installers for Windows,
macOS and Linux available here:

#### [https://github.com/xel-software/xel-lite-wallet/releases/tag/latest](https://github.com/xel-software/xel-lite-wallet/releases/tag/latest)

With them comes an auto-update functionality (when you start your wallet, it
will check the git repository for a new version, and update your wallet if
necessary).

There is also a docker-based installer for all XEL components available here:

#### [https://github.com/xel-software/xel-installer-docker](https://github.com/xel-software/xel-installer-docker)

This docker installers are better suited for server installations, you can also
start and host your own block explorer!

**Also the XEL Github was reorganized to get a clear structure and more clarity.
**We are really thankful for all the people that helped us getting that off the
ground. Special thanks goes to ek for giving us the opportunity to push updates
to this project.<br> **If you experience any problems or bugs, please let us
know.**

#### **Traveling Salesman Problem — Community Bounty!**

The XEL community is growing! There is a community bounty and you have the
chance to get 3000 XEL (~0.03BTC or ~$190 at the time of writing). For more
information about the bounty, please vist the link:

Just to be clear, we are not a XEL dev or representative, the whole community
is!

**Come and hang in Discord, Slack, Twitter, or Reddit and interact with
everyone, there’s great people.**

There’s a lot to do after that and more updates will come, we’re all counting on
you for your help!
